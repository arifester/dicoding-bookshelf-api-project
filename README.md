# Dicoding Bookshelf API Project
This project is a RESTful API developed as the final submission for the "Beginner Back-End Learning with JavaScript" course by Dicoding.
Designed to manage a digital bookshelf, the API allows users to create, read, update, and delete book records effectively.
The application is built using **Node.js** and the **Hapi Framework** to ensure robust server performance and modular routing.
It utilizes **Nanoid** for generating unique identifiers and adheres to strict code quality standards using **ESLint** with the **Google Style Guide**.
